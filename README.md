# Food Recognition CNN Model

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing different types of food items. The model is trained using the Food-101 dataset, which contains images of 101 different food categories.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-recognition.git
    ```

2. Download the Food-101 dataset from the official website: [Food-101 Dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101.tar.gz)

3. Extract the dataset files and place them in the project directory.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd food-recognition
    ```

2. Run the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

3. After training, you can use the model for predicting food items from images:

    ```
    python predict.py path_to_image.jpg
    ```

## Note on Model Upload

Due to significant upload times to GitHub, the trained model file (`food_classification_model.h5`) could not be uploaded directly. If you're interested in accessing the model, please connect with me on LinkedIn, and I can share it with you directly.
